You can download the .nro from the latest release or get it from the [Homebrew App Store](https://apps.fortheusers.org/switch/PongNX).   
Then, you can use an [emulator](https://yuzu-emu.org/) or a [cracked Switch](https://www.cfwaifu.com/atmosphere-tinfoil/) to run it.
## Description
A simple Nintendo Switch version of Pong.
It was made using SDL2 and written in C++.

I made the same game for the 3DS :

Any other button will start the game if it isn't already.
